            <h1>TUBERCULOSIS</h1>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35);">Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. <br>
                The symptoms of TB can vary depending on whether the infection is active or latent. <br>
                Latent TB infection may not cause any symptoms, while active TB disease is associated with noticeable symptoms.

                <li><b>Persistent Cough : </b>A cough that lasts for more than three weeks is a common symptom of active TB. 
                    The cough may produce sputum or phlegm, and it may be accompanied by blood in severe cases.</li>
                <li><b>Chest Pain : </b>Pain or discomfort in the chest can occur, especially when breathing or coughing. This can be a result of inflammation in the lungs.
                    </li>
                <li><b>Fatigue and Weakness : </b>Individuals with active TB may experience persistent fatigue, weakness, and a general feeling of being unwell.</li>
                <li><b>Weight Loss : </b>Unexplained weight loss is a common symptom of TB. It may be accompanied by a loss of appetite.</li>
                <li><b>Fever and Chills : </b>Low-grade fever, particularly in the afternoon and evening, is a common symptom. Chills and night sweats may also occur.</li>
                <li><b>Shortness of Breath : </b>As TB progresses, it can lead to shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.</li>

            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">1.	Isoniazid (INH):</h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">
                •	Often a key component of TB treatment. <br>
                •	Typically taken daily for a specified duration, usually 6 to 9 months. <br>
                •	Individuals with active TB may be prescribed a combination of medications, such as isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. <br>
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">2.	Rifampin (RIF):</h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">
                •	Another cornerstone of TB treatment. <br>
                •	Usually taken daily for a specified duration, often in combination with INH.                
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">3.	Pyrazinamide (PZA):</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">
                •	Often included in the initial phase of treatment. <br>
                •	Typically taken for the first 2 months of TB treatment.  
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">4.	Ethambutol (EMB):</h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">              
                •	May be included in the initial phase, especially when drug resistance is suspected. <br>
                •	Dosage and duration vary based on the patient's weight and other factors.

            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">3.	Good Respiratory Hygiene:</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	 Individuals with active TB should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue or the elbow of their arm when coughing or sneezing to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">4.	Ventilation:</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	 Ensure good ventilation in living spaces, workplaces, and healthcare settings to reduce the concentration of infectious particles in the air.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">5.	Use of Respiratory Protection:</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	 Individuals with active TB should wear masks to reduce the risk of spreading respiratory droplets. Healthcare workers may also use masks when caring for TB patients.
