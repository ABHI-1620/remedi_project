            <h1>POLIO</h1>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35);">Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the poliovirus.  <br>
                Most people infected with the poliovirus do not exhibit any symptoms and may not even be aware that they are infected. <br>
                However, in some cases, the virus can cause a range of symptoms.

        <div>
            <ul style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35); padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 6%">
                <li><b>Subclinical Infection : </b>Many people infected with the poliovirus do not develop any symptoms. 
                    This is referred to as a subclinical infection. Despite not showing symptoms, individuals with subclinical infections can still spread the virus to others.</li>
                <li><b>Non-Paralytic Polio (Abortive Polio) : </b> In some cases, individuals may experience mild, flu-like symptoms, which may include:  <br>
                    •	Fever <br>
                    •	Sore throat <br>
                    •	Headache <br>
                    •	Fatigue <br>
                    •	Muscle and joint pain <br>
                    •	Nausea <br>
                    These symptoms typically last for a few days to a week and then resolve without causing paralysis.
                    </li>
                <li><b>Paralytic Polio : </b> A small percentage of polio cases progress to paralytic polio, which is the most severe form of the disease. Paralytic polio is characterized by the following symptoms: <br>
                    •	Initial Flu-like Symptoms: Similar to non-paralytic polio, individuals may experience fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue.<br>
                    •	Muscle weakness or paralysis, often asymmetrical (affecting one side of the body more than the other) <br>
                    •	Loss of reflexes <br>
                    •	Severe spasms or stiffness in the limbs <br>
                    •	Respiratory Involvement: In some cases, the muscles involved in breathing may be affected, leading to respiratory distress, which can be life-threatening. <br>
                    </li>

            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">MEDICATION</h2>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">1.	Vaccination:</h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)"> Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent polio. Both OPV and IPV are used in various vaccination programs. 
                The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a series of doses to ensure immunity. 
                Vaccination efforts, often part of routine childhood immunization schedules, have been successful in reducing the global incidence of polio.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">2.	Supportive Care: </h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">For individuals with symptoms of non-paralytic or paralytic polio, supportive care is provided to alleviate symptoms and help the person recover. 
                This may include bed rest, pain management, and physical therapy.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">3.	Respiratory Support: </h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">In severe cases of paralytic polio, where respiratory muscles are affected, respiratory support may be necessary. Mechanical ventilation or breathing assistance can be employed to help the individual breathe.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">4.	Physical Therapy: </h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">For individuals who experience muscle weakness or paralysis, physical therapy can be beneficial in maintaining or improving muscle function. 
                Rehabilitation efforts aim to enhance mobility and prevent complications such as joint contractures.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">SAFETY MEASURES</h2>
            <P style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	To prevent the spread of polio and protect individuals from the virus, various safety measures and preventive strategies are implemented. 
            </P>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">1.	Vaccination:</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	Ensure routine childhood immunization: Follow national vaccination schedules to ensure that children receive the recommended doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). <br>
                •	Booster doses: Periodic booster doses are often recommended to maintain immunity throughout life. <br>
                •	Participate in vaccination campaigns: Support and participate in national and global vaccination campaigns to reach high levels of population immunity.                
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">2.	Good Hygiene Practices:</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	Promote hand hygiene: Encourage regular handwashing with soap and water, especially after using the toilet and before handling food. <br>
                •	Sanitation: Ensure access to safe and clean sanitation facilities to prevent the contamination of water sources.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">3.	Public Health Surveillance:</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	Early detection: Maintain robust surveillance systems to detect and respond to any cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), a symptom associated with paralytic polio. <br>
                •	Reporting: Healthcare providers and laboratories are required to report cases of AFP promptly to public health authorities.                
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">4.	Safe Water and Food Practices:</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	Access to clean water: Ensure access to safe and clean drinking water to prevent waterborne transmission of the poliovirus. <br>
                •	Safe food handling: Promote safe food handling and hygiene practices to prevent the contamination of food with the virus.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">5.	Travel Precautions:</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	Travel vaccinations: Individuals traveling to areas with known polio transmission should check their vaccination status and, if necessary, receive a booster dose before travel.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">SIDE EFFECTS</h2>
            <P style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">Vaccination, especially with the oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), is generally safe and effective in preventing polio. However, like any medical intervention, vaccines may have side effects. 
                It's important to note that the benefits of vaccination in preventing polio and its potentially severe consequences usually far outweigh the risks of side effects. 
                Common side effects are typically mild and temporary. Here are some potential side effects associated with polio vaccination:<br>
                <b> 1.	Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV): </b><br>
                    •	Mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting may occur. <br>
                    •	In very rare cases, the weakened, live virus in OPV can mutate and cause vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), which can lead to outbreaks. This is more likely to occur in areas with low vaccination coverage. <br>
                <b>2.	Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV):</b><br>
                    •	Soreness or redness at the injection site is a common and mild side effect. <br>
                    •	Serious side effects are extremely rare. Allergic reactions are possible but are extremely uncommon.
