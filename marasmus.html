            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">General objectives : </h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)"> Management of moderate marasmus can be performed on an outpatient basis, but severe marasmus or marasmus complicated by a life-threatening condition generally requires inpatient treatment. 
                In these cases, management is divided into an initial intensive phase followed by a consolidation phase (rehabilitation), preparing for outpatient follow-up management. 
                The WHO has developed guidelines to help improve the quality of hospital care for malnourished children and has prioritized the widespread implementation of these guidelines

            <P style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	Marasmus is a life-threatening medical emergency. When symptoms appear, the person needs treatment straight away. <br>
                •	Rapid weight loss, infections, and sudden changes in behavior or appetite could be signs of an underlying problem, such as an eating disorder or a chronic health condition. <br>
                •	A medical professional will need to prepare a specific eating plan for anyone with a diagnosis of marasmus. <br>
                •	If the person has anorexia nervosa, a team of professionals may be involved.
