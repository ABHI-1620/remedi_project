            <h1>EMPHYSEMA</h1>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35);">Emphysema is primarily a pathological diagnosis that affects the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole. <br>
                It is characterized by abnormal permanent enlargement of lung air spaces with the destruction of their walls without any fibrosis and destruction of lung parenchyma with loss of elasticity.

            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">MEDICATION</h2>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">Depending upon the severity of your symptoms, your doctor might suggest:</h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">Bronchodilators. These drugs can help relieve coughing, shortness of breath and breathing problems by relaxing constricted airways.
                Inhaled steroids. Corticosteroid drugs inhaled as aerosol sprays reduce inflammation and may help relieve shortness of breath.
                Antibiotics. If you have a bacterial infection, like acute bronchitis or pneumonia, antibiotics are appropriate.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">SCANS AND TESTS</h2><P style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	<b>Imaging tests: </b>A chest X-ray can help support a diagnosis of advanced emphysema and rule out other causes of shortness of breath. But the chest X-ray can also show normal findings if you have emphysema.<br>
                •	<b>Lab tests: </b>Blood taken from an artery in your wrist can be tested to determine how well your lungs transfer oxygen into, and remove carbon dioxide from, your bloodstream.<br>
                •	<b>Lung function tests: </b>These noninvasive tests measure how much air your lungs can hold and how well the air flows in and out of your lungs. They can also measure how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your bloodstream. One of the most common tests uses a simple instrument called a spirometer, which you blow into.<br>

            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">SURGERIES:</h2>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">Depending on the severity of your emphysema, your doctor may suggest one or more different types of surgery, including:</h4>
            <P style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	<b>Lung volume reduction surgery: </b>  In this procedure, surgeons remove small wedges of damaged lung tissue. Removing the diseased tissue helps the remaining lung tissue expand and work more efficiently and helps improve breathing.</P>
            <P style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	<b>Lung transplant: </b> Lung transplantation is an option if you have severe lung damage and other options have failed.</P>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">POSY MEDICATION CARE: </h2>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">A person with emphysema can take part in a respiratory rehabilitation program, commonly known as ‘pulmonary rehab’. These programs:</h4>
            <P style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">•	<b>Teach you breathing techniques: </b> These techniques can help you breathe more efficiently and conserve energy.<br>
                •	<b>Help you exercise: </b> Exercise can strengthen the muscles you use for breathing and improve your overall endurance.<br>
                •	<b>Provide counseling: </b> Counseling can help you learn to manage anxiety and depression that may accompany your condition.<br>
                •	<b>Offer nutrition advice: </b> A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength.<br>
                •	<b>Provide education: </b> Learning more about your condition can empower you to take control of your health.<br>
