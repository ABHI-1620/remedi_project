            <h1>CHOLERA</h1>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35);">Cholera is a bacterial disease usually spread through contaminated water. Cholera causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. <br>
                Left untreated, cholera can be fatal within hours, even in previously healthy people. <br> 
                Modern sewage and water treatment have virtually eliminated cholera in industrialized countries.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0); padding-left: 10%; ">SYMPTOMS</h2>
        <div>
            <ul style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35); padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 6%">
                <li><b>Diarrhea: </b>Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss — as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. 
                    Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed.</li>
                <li><b>Nausea and vomiting:</b>Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours.</li>
                <li><b>Dehydration: </b>Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">MEDICATION</h2>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">1. Cholera vaccine :</h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">People traveling from the United States to areas affected by cholera can get a cholera vaccine called Vaxchora.
                It's suggested for people between ages 2 and 64 who plan to travel where cholera is being spread or regularly spreads.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">2. Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) :</h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">This is the preferred and most common method of treatment for mild to moderate cases of cholera.
                ORT involves drinking a solution of oral rehydration salts (ORS), which contains a specific balance of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate) and glucose.
                ORS helps to replace the lost fluids and electrolytes and prevent dehydration.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">3. Intravenous Rehydration :</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">In severe cases of cholera, especially when dehydration is significant, intravenous (IV) rehydration may be necessary.
                This involves administering fluids and electrolytes directly into the bloodstream through a vein.
                This method is often used when the patient cannot tolerate oral fluids or when the dehydration is severe.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color:  rgb(91, 3, 5);">4. Zinc Supplementation :</h4>
            <p style="color:rgb(3, 35, 35)">In addition to rehydration therapy, zinc supplementation may be recommended, especially in children.
                Zinc can help reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">SAFETY MEASURES</h2>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">1.	Continue Rehydration: </h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">If oral rehydration therapy (ORT) or intravenous rehydration was administered as part of the treatment, continue to ensure adequate fluid intake. 
                Even after the symptoms start to improve, it's essential to maintain hydration levels until the body fully recovers.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">2.	Follow Antibiotic Course: </h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">If antibiotics were prescribed, complete the full course as directed by the healthcare provider, even if symptoms improve before the medication is finished. 
                This helps ensure the bacteria are completely eradicated.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">3.	Practice Good Hygiene: </h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">Cholera is highly contagious, and maintaining good hygiene is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease. 
                Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the toilet and before handling food. Use proper sanitation facilities to dispose of feces.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(91, 3, 5);">4.	Isolation Precautions: </h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">If someone has been diagnosed with cholera, they should follow isolation precautions to prevent the spread of the bacteria to others. 
                This includes avoiding close contact with family members and practicing strict hygiene measures until a healthcare professional provides clearance.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 115, 0);">SIDE EFFECTS</h2>
            <P style="color: rgb(3, 35, 35)">The medications used to treat cholera, such as antibiotics and rehydration solutions, may have potential side effects. 
                It's important to note that the benefits of treatment usually outweigh the risks, especially in the case of a severe and potentially life-threatening infection like cholera. <br>
                •	Antibiotics: Antibiotics may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. <br>
                •	Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT): ORT may cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. <br>
                •	Intravenous Rehydration: Intravenous rehydration may cause side effects such as swelling, bruising, and pain at the injection site. <br>
                •	Zinc Supplementation: Zinc supplementation may cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. <br>
